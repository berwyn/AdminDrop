Plugin currently is for preventing users with permissions or those that have this forced upon them to have drops on death and throwing of items disabled.

The goal of this plugin is to handle all item actions (Dropping, Throwing, Picking Up, etc.).

    AdminDrop.list - List all users with toggles on.
    AdminDrop.mo - Modify other user's drops on death toggle.
    AdminDrop.ad - Set one's own drops on death toggle.
    AdminDrop.s - Check one's own status of toggles.
    AdminDrop.so - Check status of other's toggles.
    AdminDrop.ta - Set ones's own throwing away toggle
    AdminDrop.dd - Makes toggle for drops on death always on.

Commands:

    /ad - Toggles drops on death
    /ad [player] - Toggles other's drops on death
    /ad list - Lists users with Toggle on
    /ad status - Gets current status of toggles
    /ad status [player] - Gets players current status of toggles
    /ad ta - Toggles ability to throw away items

Features:

    Stops the dropping of items on death on self or target player.
    Stops the ability to throw items.
    Lists players with toggles enabled.
    Checks personal status of toggles and that of other players.

Notes:

    This is the first stable release build for this plugin. 

    Items currently do not stay in inventory on death if drops are toggled to not drop, they just simply does not drop them. This is a proposed future feature. 

This plugin was Co-Authored by pyropyro78 and NitroNumberOne.
