The goal of this plugin is to allow a user/admin with proper permissions (or who is OP) to toggle the dropping of items on death.

Permissions:

    AdminDrop.list - The list command.
    AdminDrop.mo - Modify other user's toggle.
    AdminDrop.ad - Set one's own toggle.
    AdminDrop.s - Check one's own status.
    AdminDrop.so - Check status of other. 

Commands:

    /ad - Toggles on/off
    /ad [player] - Toggles other on/off
    /ad list - Lists users with Toggle on
    /ad status - Gets current status
    /ad status [player] - Gets players current status 

Features:

    Stops the dropping of items on death on self or target player.
    Lists players with it enabled.
    Checks personal status and other player's status of toggle. 

Notes:

    This is the first stable release build for this plugin. 

    Items currently do not stay in inventory on death, just simply does not drop them. This is a proposed future feature. 

This plugin was Co-Authored by pyropyro78 and NitroNumberOne.
